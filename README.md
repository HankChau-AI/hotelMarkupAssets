Challenge #3 Hamster Hotel

11/1/24

Created a mock-up website of Hamster Hotel. Is properly responsive from Laptop(L) 1440px, Laptop 1024px, to Tablet 768px. Is semi-responsive at Mobile 425px but half is broken. Uses bootstrap, properly working buttons and navbar, and use of media queries.

Peer Review David M: 1440px looks really good, 1024px is not as nice but works fine, tablet 768px looks fine as well, mobile 425px and below doesn't really work needs improvement if implementing responsiveness.
